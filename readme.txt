Cherry on Top

Game Overview
Cherry on Top is a game in which the player must catch falling scoops of ice cream in order to fulfill the randomized order that is given at the beginning of each level.
The game derives its name from the condition that a player must meet to complete the order and move on to the next level: catch a cherry on top of the ice cream cone.
Levels will go on endlessly until the player catches a cherry without first completing the order, which results in Game Over. As the game progresses, the difficulty increases
as the objects fall faster, and there are more items that the player must catch to fulfill the order.

Command to Run File

the following into the command prompt: python final_game.py. From there, the game will run itself with no other input required from the user other than pressing the space bar to
